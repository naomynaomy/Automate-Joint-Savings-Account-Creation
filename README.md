# Automate Joint Savings Account Creation

The purpose of this project was to create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. Your smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

The steps taken to achieve this were as follows:

1. Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity

2. Compile and Deploy Your Contract in the Remix VM (London)

3. Interact with Your Deployed Smart Contract

Two dummy accounts were used to test the functionality of the smart contract:

Dummy account1 address: 0x0c0669Cd5e60a6F4b8ce437E4a4A007093D368Cb
Dummy account2 address: 0x7A1f3dFAa0a4a19844B606CD6e91d693083B12c0
